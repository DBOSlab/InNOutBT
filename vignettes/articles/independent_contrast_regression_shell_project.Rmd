The main goal of the __InNOutBT__ package is to readily create input data and
process output data for Meade & Pagel's (2022) [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html) 
program.\

Here in this article, we show how to use __InNOutBT__'s function `BayesTraits.shell.reg.proj`
for producing shell scripts and associated run commands of BayesTraits phylogenetic 
independent contrast regression analyses. Basically, the function `BayesTraits.shell`
uses the directory paths to the tree, mean and linked data files as created with
`BayesTraits.inputs` (see article [here](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/independent_contrast_regression_inputs.html)),
to automatically produce shell scripts in both Unix and Windows PowerShell formats. 
The resulting single shell script file can then be used for running one or all-in-once
multiple BayesTraits phylogenetic regressions, without manually setting new analyses
with new parameters. The shell script produced with `BayesTraits.shell` should 
have thus all parameters for all analyses with any defined model. In addition to 
save the shell script directly in BayesTraits directory, the function saves all 
the separate running files with BayesTraits specified parameters (bi, it, sa, and
st) for any run, depending on the chosen model of tree transformation. See [BayesTraits V4.0.0 Manual](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Manual.pdf)
for further details on each of BayesTraits parameters available for phylogenetic
regression so as to better understand how to set the arguments of `BayesTraits.shell`.\

# Setup

__InNOutBT__ is not on CRAN yet but you can install the latest development version 
from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DBOSlab/InNOutBT")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)
```
\

# Creating a Unix shell project folder

Set the argument `syst = "unix"` to create a shell script for running the phylogenetic
regressions with macOS Monterey.\

Note that you should give the name of the response variable of your analysis in
the argument `responvar`. Also, you should use the argument `treetransf` to define
any or all (listed as a vector) available tree transformation models that you want
to run the phylogenetic regressions with your input data. As such, choose among 
the models *Kappa*, *Delta*, *Lambda*, *OU* (Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck), *UNI* (if you 
have set a complete default BayesTraits regression analysis, i.e. assumed a uniform
rates of evolution no other tree transformation models were estimated), *VR* (if 
you have used a variable rates) or *Fabric* (if you want to use the general statistical
mode that accommodates uneven evolutionary landscape as described by [Pagel et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28595-z)).\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)

BayesTraits.shell.reg.proj(dir_create_proj = "/Users/domingoscardoso/Downloads",
                           syst = "unix")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shell_unix.png", dpi = 300)
```
\
\

# Running the Unix shell script 

After using the function `BayesTraits.shell.reg.proj` with all the needed parameters, you 
have to set permission to the shell script to run automatically all the phylogenetic 
regression analyses with BayesTraits program. You can just follow the steps below.\

__1.__ Open the terminal;\

__2.__ Go to the BayesTraits program folder where you have saved the shell script 
file __.sh__ and the associated running and input data files with the function `BayesTraits.shell`.
The shell script should be named __BayesTraits_full_shell_unix.sh__;\

__3.__ Execute the following line:\
__chmod 777 BayesTraits_full_shell_unix.sh__

__4.__ Then perform the BayesTraits run using the shell script by executing the following line:\
__./BayesTraits_full_shell_unix.sh__
\
\

# Creating a Windows PowerShell project folder

Set the argument `syst = "windows"` to create a PowerShell script for running the 
phylogenetic regressions with Windows. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BayesTraits.shell.reg.proj(dir_create_proj = "/Users/domingoscardoso/Downloads",
                           syst = "windows")```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shell_windows.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
\
The function generates all running BayesTraits commands for the multiple regressions,
depending on the parameters set in the arguments `treetransf`, `bi`, `it`, `sa`, 
and `st`.\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shell_bayestraits_running_commands.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
\
Note that because we have set the argument `cc_DataTree = TRUE`, then the tree, 
mean data, and linked data files were also copied directly into the BayesTraits folder.\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bayestraits_folder.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
\
Note that if you set any of the arguments `Kappa`, `Delta`, `Lambda`, and `OU` as
the default *NULL*, these tree transformation models will be estimated, provided
that any of them were also listed in the argument `treetransf`. But you can also
set them as a vector with any specific value between 0 and 1. For example, if you 
want to run analyses with both specific and estimated values for `Lambda`, then 
you have to set a vector such as *c("0.001", "1.0", "Estimate")*.\
\
Also, if you define the logical argument `VRLambda` as *TRUE*, then the specific values 
set for the tree transformation models at the parameters `Kappa`, `Delta`, `Lambda`
or `OU` will be considered as separate runs when using the model of variable rates
*VR*, provided that you have also chosen this model in the parameter `treetransf`.

# Running the Windows PowerShell script 

After using the function `BayesTraits.shell.reg.proj` with all the needed parameters, you 
have to set permission to the PowerShell script to run automatically all the 
phylogenetic regression analyses with BayesTraits program. You can just follow the
steps below, but you may also want to find [further information on how to use Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.2).

__1.__ Open PowerShell as Administrator;\

__2.__ Go to the BayesTraits program folder where you have saved the PowerShell script
file __.ps1__ and the associated running and input data files with the function `BayesTraits.shell`.
The PowerShell script should be named __BayesTraits_full_shell_windows.ps1__;\

__3.__ Execute the following line and choose option __[Y]Yes__;\
__Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine__

__4.__ Execute the following line:\
__Unblock-File -Path .\\BayesTraits_full_shell_windows.ps1__

__5.__ Then perform the BayesTraits run using the PowerShell script by executing the following line:\
__.\\BayesTraits_full_shell_windows.ps1__
