The main goal of the __InNOutBT__ package is to readily create input data and
process output data for Meade & Pagel's (2022) [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html) 
program.\

Here we show how to use the package's function `BayesTraits.outputs`
for processing all Log and Stones output text files from BayesTraits phylogenetic 
independent contrast regression analyses.\
\

# Setup

__InNOutBT__ is not on CRAN yet but you can install the latest development version 
from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DBOSlab/InNOutBT")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)
```
\

# Processing Log and Stone output files

The function `BayesTraits.outputs` reads and processes the Log and Stones .txt 
output files resulting from the independent contrast regression analyses and generates 
tables in Word or CSV formats, which summarizes competing model and ranks them by
log likelihood scores. Heatmaps derived from pairwise Bayes Factors are generated 
in PDF format and these can be used to identify competing modes that are most similar
to the model with the highest log likelihood score.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)

BayesTraits.outputs(logst_dir = paste0(getwd(),"/BayesTraits_outputs_log_stone"),
                    responvar = "DBH",
                    explanvar = c("bio12", "bio15", "nnodes"),
                    treetransf = c("Kappa", "Delta", "Lambda", "OU", "UNI", "VR", "Fabric"),
                    bayesfactor = TRUE,
                    unirates = FALSE,
                    outformat = c("Word", "CSV"),
                    tableleg = "Phylogenetic regression in BayesTraits: models and coefficients.",
                    dir_create = "results_BayesTraits_output",
                    outfile = "BayesTraits_output_table",
                    height = 12,
                    width = 15)
```

\
\
Heatmap including Bayes Factor pairwise comparison:\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bayes_factor_heatmap.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
\
Heatmap clustering models based on Bayes Factor values:\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bayes_factor_heatmap_cluster.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
\
Table describing the models and coefficients:\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/word_table_model_comparisons.png", dpi = 300)
```
