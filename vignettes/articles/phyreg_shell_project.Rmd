The main goal of the __InNOutBT__ package is to readily create input data and
process output data for Meade & Pagel's (2022) [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html) 
program.\

Here in this article, we show how to use __InNOutBT__'s function `shell.phyreg.proj`
for a full shell script run and log processing multiple phylogenetic regression 
analyses with Meade & Pagel's (2022) [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html) 
program. By reporting a directory path and the computer's operating system 
("unix" or "windows"), this function creates the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__
with associated example scripts.\

The available example of a shell script in Unix or Windows PowerShell helps to 
fully automatize both the complete BayesTraits regression analyses and processing 
of the resulting log and stones files, by automatically running the three main 
__InNOutBT__ functions `phyreg.inputs`, `phyreg.shell`, and `phyreg.outputs`, 
without directly opening the R or R Studio programs.\

Note that  the __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__ folder that comes with __InNOutBT__ 
package was originally used in our recently  published specific study on the ecological 
diversification of the Vataireoid legumes. So, you will have to edit the folder 
paths and analysis parameters in such example scripts according to your desired 
regression analyses. See the associated articles on how to set the parameters to 
[create input files ](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_inputs.html)
with `phyreg.inputs` for the phylogenetic regression analyses, as well to 
[create the internal shell script](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_shell.html) 
with `phyreg.shell` for the actual BayesTraits runs, and to 
[process the resulting output files](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_outputs.html)
with `phyreg.outputs`. You might also want to see [BayesTraits V4.0.0 Manual](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Manual.pdf)
for further details on each of BayesTraits parameters available for phylogenetic
regressions so as to better understand how to set the arguments available in the
__InNOutBT__ functions.\
\

# Setup

__InNOutBT__ is not on CRAN yet but you can install the latest development version 
from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DBOSlab/InNOutBT")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)
```
\

# Creating a Unix shell project folder

The `shell.phyreg.proj` function is very simple and has only two arguments. By just 
setting any path in your computer and the argument `syst = "unix"`, you can readily
create the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__ with associate 
example files (R scripts, shell script, and data folder) for running the phylogenetic
regressions of the Vataireoid legumes with macOS Monterey. But then you can easily 
modify such available scripts for your specific analyses.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)

shell.phyreg.proj(dir_create_proj = "/Users/domingoscardoso",
                  syst = "unix")
```

After running `shell.phyreg.proj` function, it will readily create the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__, a data folder with the input data files 
__vataireoids_1610_25May2022_BayesTraits.csv__ and __vatcomb30_24May22_Yule.con.tree__,
as well as the main shell script __BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_unix.sh__ and R 
scripts __1_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_inputs.R__, __2_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_shell.R__,
and __3_processing_BayesTraits_phyreg_outputs.R__.\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/unix_shell_project.png", dpi = 300)
```
\
\
You should see the associated articles on how to set the parameters to 
[create input files ](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_inputs.html)
with `phyreg.inputs` for the phylogenetic regression analyses, as well to 
[create the internal shell script](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_shell.html) 
with `phyreg.shell` for the actual BayesTraits runs, and to 
[process the resulting output files](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_outputs.html)
with `phyreg.outputs`. In these articles, you will find how to fully edit the R 
scripts __1_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_inputs.R__, __2_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_shell.R__,
and __3_processing_BayesTraits_phyreg_outputs.R__ according to your particular study.
Otherwise, if you run the example files with the same parameter settings, you will 
be able to fully reproduce the analysis of our Vataireoid legume study.\

Note that for running the main shell script file __BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_unix.sh__,
which performs the full phylogenetic regression analysis and processing of results,
you will just need to give the path to both the project run folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__, 
and the BayesTraits program folder where the executable program is installed. These
should be set as the variables __PROJECTFOLDER__ and __BAYESTRFOLDER__, as shown
in the image bellow. Also, if you define your e-mail address at the variable __EMAIL__,
then you will receive an automatic e-mail message when your analyses are finished.\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/unix_shell_project_script.png", dpi = 300)
```

# Running the Unix shell script 

After using the function `shell.phyreg.proj` with all the needed parameters, you 
have to set permission to the main shell script file so as to run automatically 
all the three R scripts and the phylogenetic regression analyses with BayesTraits 
program. To do that, please follow the steps below.\

__1.__ Open the terminal;\

__2.__ Move your current working directory to the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__, 
i.e. the same where you should have the main shell script file __BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_unix.sh__;\

__3.__ Execute the following line:\
__chmod 777 BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_unix.sh__

__4.__ Then perform the full R and BayesTraits run using the shell script by executing the following line:\
__./BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_unix.sh__
\
\

# Creating a Windows PowerShell project folder

In the `shell.phyreg.proj` function, you can set any path in your PC and the argument
`syst = "windows"` to readily create the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__ 
with associate example files (R scripts, PowerShell script, and data folder) for running
the phylogenetic regressions of the Vataireoid legumes with Windows PC. But then you 
can easily modify such available scripts for your specific analyses.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)

shell.phyreg.proj(dir_create_proj = "/Users/domingoscardoso",
                  syst = "windows")
```

After running `shell.phyreg.proj` function, it will readily create the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__, a data folder with the input data files 
__vataireoids_1610_25May2022_BayesTraits.csv__ and __vatcomb30_24May22_Yule.con.tree__,
as well as the main PowerShell script __BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_windows.ps1__ 
and R scripts __1_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_inputs.R__, __2_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_shell.R__,
and __3_processing_BayesTraits_phyreg_outputs.R__.\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/windows_shell_project.png", dpi = 300)
```
\
\
You should see the associated articles on how to set the parameters to 
[create input files ](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_inputs.html)
with `phyreg.inputs` for the phylogenetic regression analyses, as well to 
[create the internal shell script](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_shell.html) 
with `phyreg.shell` for the actual BayesTraits runs, and to 
[process the resulting output files](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/phyreg_outputs.html)
with `phyreg.outputs`. In these articles, you will find how to fully edit the R 
scripts __1_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_inputs.R__, __2_producing_BayesTraits_phyreg_shell.R__,
and __3_processing_BayesTraits_phyreg_outputs.R__ according to your particular study.
Otherwise, if you run the example files with the same parameter settings, you will 
be able to fully reproduce the analysis of our Vataireoid legume study.\

Note that for running the main PowerShell script file __BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_windows.ps1__
which performs the full phylogenetic regression analyses and processing of results,
you will just need to give the path to the project run folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__, 
the BayesTraits, R, Adobe Acrobat, and Microsoft Office program folders where their 
corresponding executable programs are installed. These should be set, respectively,
as the variables __$PROJECTFOLDER__, __$BAYESTRFOLDER__, __$RFOLDER__, __$ACROBATFOLDER__, 
and __$WORDFOLDER__, as shown in the image bellow:\
\
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/windows_shell_project_script.png", dpi = 300)
```

# Running the Windows PowerShell script 

After using the function `shell.phyreg.proj` with all the needed parameters, you 
have to set permission to the main PowerShell script so as to run automatically 
all the three R scripts and the phylogenetic regression analyses with BayesTraits 
program. To do that, please follow the steps below, but you may also want to find
[further information on how to use Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.2).\

__1.__ Open PowerShell as Administrator;\

__2.__ Move your current working directory to the project folder __BayesTraits_shell_phyreg_project__, 
i.e. the same where you should have the main shell script file __BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_windows.ps1__;\

__3.__ Execute the following line and choose option __[Y]Yes__;\
__Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine__

__4.__ Execute the following line:\
__Unblock-File -Path .\\BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_windows.ps1__

__5.__ Then perform the full R and BayesTraits run using the PowerShell script by executing the following line:\
__.\\BayesTraits_full_phyreg_shell_windows.ps1__
