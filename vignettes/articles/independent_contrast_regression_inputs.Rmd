The main goal of the __InNOutBT__ package is to readily create input data and
process output data for Meade & Pagel's (2022) [BayesTraits](http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html) 
program.\

We describe how the __InNOutBT__'s function `BayesTraits.inputs` creates two input
text files representing samples of trait/climate data. One text file reports mean
values for each sample of traits and a second text file reports linked samples of
trait values (distribution data) in a format used in the phylogenetic independent
contrast regression analyses. This function includes an argument to calculate the
net node count for each species/accession given a phylogenetic tree, which is used
to explore the effects of speciation rates on the response variable (e.g. [O’Donovan et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0454-6)).\


# Setup

__InNOutBT__ is not on CRAN yet but you can install the latest development version 
from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DBOSlab/InNOutBT")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)
```


# Example of spreadsheet with georeferenced data and associated traits

Outputting longitude and latitude data (columns arranged in that order) with the 
terminal label column provides the required data formats of the mean and linked 
data that can be analyzed using the Geographical Model in BayesTraits. Before using
`BayesTraits.inputs`, make sure your spreadsheet with georeferenced data and associated
traits also includes a **terminal** column where each accession/sample is linked
to the corresponding tip label in the input phylogenetic tree.\

```


# Create sample of trait data using a subset of explanatory variables

The example below generates the linked and mean data files where "DBH" is defined 
as the response variable because it is listed first and "bio12" and "bio15" are 
the explanatory variables because they are listed second and third. Thus, the first
name reported in the argument `traitcols` will define the response variable.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(InNOutBT)
library(treeio)

traitdata <- read.csv("Data/vataireoids_1610_25May2022_BayesTraits.csv")
phylo <- read.beast("Data/vatcomb30_24May22_Yule.con.tree")

BayesTraits.inputs(tree = phylo,
                   data = traitdata,
                   tipscol = "terminal",
                   traitcols = c("DBH", "bio12", "bio15"),
                   dir_create = "results_BayesTraits_input",
                   fileDistData = "BayesTraits_linked_data_bio12_bio15.txt",
                   fileMeanData = "BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15.txt")
```


# Log transform any variable before creating the input mean and linked data

You may want to log-10 transform a variable before running the phylogenetic regression
analysis. In the argument `logtransf`, just report the variables/traits to be 
log-transformed. The log-transformed trait will always result in a new column 
with a new name where the additional prefix "log10" is added, as in the following:
"log10NAMEOFTHETRAIT". The name(s) of the log-transformed trait(s) to be used in 
the analyses should then be listed in the argument `addtraits`. Note that in the 
example below, the variable "DBH" was chosen to be log-transformed and also as 
the response variable. In this case, we need to reorder the variables in the argument
`ordtraits` so as to make sure your newly generated "log10DBH" variable will be 
reported first and thus serve as the response variable. You may also want to save
a copy of the original spreadsheet that includes the new column of log-transformed
DBH by reporting a name for the data file copy in the argument `fileOrigData`.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BayesTraits.inputs(tree = phylo,
                   data = traitdata,
                   tipscol = "terminal",
                   logtransf = "DBH",
                   traitcols = c("bio12", "bio15"),
                   addtraits = "log10DBH",
                   ordtraits = c("log10DBH", "bio12", "bio15"),
                   dir_create = "results_BayesTraits_input",
                   fileDistData = "BayesTraits_linked_data_bio12_bio15.txt",
                   fileMeanData = "BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15.txt",
                   fileOrigData = "vataireoids_1610_25May2022_BayesTraits_DBH_logtransf.csv")
```


# Create sample of trait data using a different subset of explanatory variables

By setting the argument `NodeCount = TRUE`, the function will calculate the net 
node count for each species/accession given the phylogenetic tree of reference. 
Net nodes or node count was used to explore the effects of speciation rates 
(e.g. [O’Donovan et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0454-6)) on the 
response variable. In the example below we chose to log10-transform both the response
variable "DBH" and the newly created column of net nodes, all which were then listed
in the arguments `addtraits` and `ordtraits`.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BayesTraits.inputs(tree = phylo,
                   data = traitdata,
                   tipscol = "terminal",
                   NodeCount = TRUE,
                   logtransf = c("DBH", "NodeCount"),
                   traitcols = c("bio12", "bio15"),
                   addtraits = c("log10NodeCount", "log10DBH"),
                   ordtraits = c("log10DBH", "bio12", "bio15", "log10NodeCount"),
                   dir_create = "results_BayesTraits_input",
                   fileDistData = "BayesTraits_linked_data_bio12_bio15_nnodes.txt",
                   fileMeanData = "BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15_nnodes.txt",
                   fileOrigData = "vataireoids_1610_25May2022_BayesTraits_netnodes_logtransf.csv")
```


# Create sample of trait data using quadratic net nodes as the explanatory variable

You may want to square transform a variable before running the phylogenetic regressions.
You just need to provide in the argument `sqrtransf` the variables/traits to be 
squared. The square-transformed trait will always result in a new column with a 
new name where the additional prefix "sqr" is added as following: "sqrNAMEOFTHETRAIT".
The name(s) of the square-transformed trait(s) to be used in the analyses should
then be listed in the argument `addtraits`. Note that in the example below the 
newly created variable "NodeCount" was chosen to be both log10-transformed and log10-transformed squared.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BayesTraits.inputs(tree = phylo,
                   data = traitdata,
                   tips_colname = "terminal",
                   NodeCount = TRUE,
                   logtransf = c("DBH", "NodeCount"),
                   sqrtransf = c("NodeCount"),
                   addtraits = c("sqrNodeCount", "log10DBH"),
                   ordtraits = c("log10DBH", "log10NodeCount", "sqrNodeCount"),
                   dir_create = "results_BayesTraits_input",
                   fileDistData = "BayesTraits_linked_data_nnodes_nnodes2.txt",
                   fileMeanData = "BayesTraits_mean_data_nnodes_nnodes2.txt",
                   fileOrigData = "vataireoids_1610_25May2022_BayesTraits_netnodes_logtransf_sqrtransf.csv")
```


# Create sample of trait data for GEO model

The example below uses columns of "longitude" and "latitude" in the original 
spreadsheet to generate input mean and linked data for use in the Geographical 
Model of BayesTraits.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
BayesTraits.inputs(tree = phylo,
                   data = traitdata,
                   tips_colname = "terminal",
                   NodeCount = FALSE,
                   traitcols = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                   dir_create = "results_BayesTraits_input",
                   fileDistData = "BayesTraits_linked_data_GEO.txt",
                   fileMeanData = "BayesTraits_mean_data_GEO.txt")
```


Once the above text files of mean and linked samples of trait data have been created,
analyzing them can be facilitated by creating a [shell script](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/independent_contrast_regression_shell.html)) 
with `BayesTraits.shell` for multiple phylogenetic regression analyses. These BayesTraits
runs are then followed by processing the Log and Stones files, which is detailed 
in using `BayesTraits.outputs` to [process the resulting output files](https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/independent_contrast_regression_outputs.html)).
