\arguments{
\item{logst_dir}{Path to the directory where are stored the log and stepping stones files
generated during the independent contrast regression analysis. The log file(s) contain
the model options and output. The stepping stones file(s) contain the marginal log
likelihood for a given model. These files are labeled with the explanatory variable(s)
of the relevant model, where each variable is separated by an underscore. Explanatory
variables include any tree transformation included in a model, and these can include
\emph{Kappa}, \emph{Delta}, \emph{Lambda}, \emph{OU} (Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck), \emph{UNI} (for no tree transformation),
\emph{VR} (variable rates) or \emph{Fabric} (for a model that accommodates uneven evolutionary
landscape, as described by \href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28595-z}{Pagel et al. (2022)}.
Thus, Log file(s) have a format like "BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15_VR.log.txt" and
"BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15_nnodes_Lambda.log.txt" (where nnodes signifies net
nodes). This indicates that the first log file contains three explanatory variables
("bio12", "bio15", and variable rates), and the second log file contains four explanatory
variables ("bio12", "bio15", "nnodes", and Lambda). Stepping stones file(s) should be
named correspondingly (e.g., "BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15_VR.stones.txt" and
"BayesTraits_mean_data_bio12_bio15_nnodes_Lambda.stones.txt".)}

\item{responvar}{Report the name of the response variable.}

\item{explanvar}{Report the name(s) of the explanatory variable(s) exactly as
they are also written in the names of the log and stones files being processed.}

\item{treetransf}{Select any of the available BayesTraits tree transformations
(\emph{Kappa}, \emph{Delta}, \emph{Lambda}, \emph{OU}, \emph{UNI}, \emph{VR} or \emph{Fabric}) that are included
among the competing models.}

\item{bayesfactor}{Logical, if \code{FALSE}, then no Bayes Factor pairwise comparisons
will performed among the models.}

\item{unirates}{Logical, if \code{FALSE}, then models lacking tree transformations
(\emph{Kappa}, \emph{Delta}, \emph{Lambda} or \emph{OU}) and variable rates and Fabric (i.e., default values
and uniform rates of evolution are assumed) will not be displayed in the main table.}

\item{outformat}{Define either "Word" or "CSV", or both, a vector c("Word", "CSV"),
for writing the results in such formats.}

\item{tableleg}{A legend for the main table, provided that you have also chosen
\code{outformat = "Word"}. If you do not report a legend, then the Word-formatted
table will have the default legend \strong{Phylogenetic regression in BayesTraits}.}

\item{dir_create}{Path to the directory where the file(s) will be saved. the default
setting creates a directory named \strong{results_BayesTraits_phyreg_output} where the results
will be saved in a subfolder named by the current date.}

\item{outfile}{Name of the resulting table-formatted files in either "Word", "CSV",
or both (depending on the specified argument \code{outformat}). If no name is reported,
the default setting creates a file named
\emph{BayesTraits_phyreg_output_table.docx} and/or \emph{BayesTraits_phyreg_output_table.csv}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to pdf.}
}
\value{
Table in dataframe format, which is also saved in .csv format.

\description{
This function processes the output reported in the log and stones .txt files,
which are generated from the phylogenetic regression analyses in Meade & Pagel's (2022)
\href{http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html}{BayesTraits}
program. The resulting files are tables either Word or CSV formats and these rank
competing models by their likelihood scores. Bayes Factors can also be reported in the
case where models with tree transformations (e.g., either Lambda or variable rates are
estimated) always have high likelihood scores than simpler models (e.g., those with neither
Lambda nor variable rates estimated). In this case, the reported Bayes Factors pertain
to the more complex model listed in the table and the simpler nested model that didn't
involve a tree transformation. Heatmaps based on pairwise Bayes Factor comparison
are also automatically produced in PDF format. These are intended to identify
models that are most similar to the model with the highest likelihood score.
See \href{http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Manual.pdf}{BayesTraits V4.0.0 Manual}
for details of the output files produced by BayesTraits, which may facilitate an
understanding of how output files are processed with the function \code{phyreg.outputs}.
