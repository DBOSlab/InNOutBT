\arguments{
\item{meanfile_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the data file(s)
containing trait means for samples of trait data is(are) stored.}

\item{linkfile_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the data file(s)
containing samples of linked trait data is(are) stored.}

\item{treefile_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the tree file is stored.}

\item{BayesTraits_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the BayesTraits
executable file is stored.}

\item{responvar}{Report the name of the response variable of your analysis.}

\item{treetransf}{In vector format, report tree transformation models to be
estimated, such as \emph{Kappa}, \emph{Delta}, \emph{Lambda}, \emph{OU} (Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck).
A model of variable rates \emph{VR} or the \emph{Fabric} model can be reported here,
the latter of which is a statistical model accommodating an uneven evolutionary
landscape, as described by \href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28595-z}{Pagel et al. (2022)}.
We use \emph{UNI} as a designation for uniform rates of evolution where \emph{VR} is not
estimated and no other tree transformation models are estimated (e.g., Lambda
is assumed to be 1.0). In this case, "UNI" here set a complete default BayesTraits
regression analysis.}

\item{Kappa}{If set as default \code{NULL}, this tree transformation model will
be estimated, provided that it was also defined in the previous parameter \code{treetransf}.
But here you can also set a vector with any specific value between 0 and 1. If
you want to run analyses with both specific and estimated values for for \emph{Kappa},
then you have to set here a vector such as c("0.001", "1.0", "Estimate"). Report
any number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{Delta}{If set as default \code{NULL}, this tree transformation model will
be estimated, provided that it was also defined in the previous parameter \code{treetransf}.
But here you can also set a vector with any specific value between 0 and 1. If
you want to run analyses with both specific and estimated values for for \emph{Delta},
then you have to set here a vector such as c("0.001", "1.0", "Estimate"). Report
any number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{Lambda}{If set as default \code{NULL}, this tree transformation model will
be estimated, provided that it was also defined in the previous parameter \code{treetransf}.
But here you can also set a vector with any specific value between 0 and 1. If
you want to run analyses with both specific and estimated values for for \emph{Lambda},
then you have to set here a vector such as c("0.001", "1.0", "Estimate"). Report
any number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{OU}{If set as default \code{NULL}, this tree transformation model will
be estimated, provided that it was also defined in the previous parameter \code{treetransf}.
But here you can also set a vector with any specific value between 0 and 1. If
you want to run analyses with both specific and estimated values for for \emph{OU},
then you have to set here a vector such as c("0.001", "1.0", "Estimate"). Report
any number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{VRLambda}{Logical, the default is \code{FALSE}. If set as \code{TRUE},
then the specific values set for the tree transformation models \emph{Kappa}, \emph{Delta},
\emph{Lambda} or \emph{OU} will be considered as separate runs when using the model of
variable rates \emph{VR}, provided that you have also chosen this model in the parameter
\code{treetransf}.}

\item{bi}{Set the number of iterations for the MCMC burnin. Report this number
as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{it}{Set the number of total iterations for the MCMC chain. Report this
number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{sa}{Set the sample frequency. Report this number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{st}{The stepping stone sampler to estimate the marginal likelihood. Report
the number of stones to use and the number of iterations for each stone as
characters (i.e., a vector of numbers each in quotes).}

\item{syst}{Report the operating system ("unix" or "windows").}

\item{dir_create}{Path to the computer's working directory or where the file(s)
will be saved. The default setting creates a directory "results_BayesTraits_output"
in which the results will be saved within a subfolder named by the current date.}

\item{cc_DataTree}{Logical, the default is \code{TRUE}. A copy of the tree file
and the mean and linked data files will be made in the BayesTraits folder where
the BayesTraits executable file is located.}

\description{
By reporting the directory paths to the tree and data files, this
function produces shell scripts in both Unix and Windows PowerShell formats
for running one or multiple phylogenetic regression analyses with Meade & Pagel's
(2022) \href{http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html}{BayesTraits}
program. In addition to generating the shell script directly in the BayesTraits
directory, the function also creates BayesTraits batch files with specified
parameters, including generations set for burnin, iterations, and the stepping
stones sampler (e.g., bi, it, sa, and st). In addition, models involving alternative
tree transformations can be specified. See \href{http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Manual.pdf}{BayesTraits V4.0.0 Manual}
for further details involving BayesTraits parameters and default settings for
independent contrast regression analysis so as to better understand how to set
arguments of this function \code{BayesTraits.shell}. You might consider using
the function \code{\link{BayesTraits.inputs}} to generate properly formatted
input files of mean and linked samples of trait data prior to using \code{BayesTraits.shell}.
See also a more complete article on how to create a \href{https://dboslab.github.io/InNOutBT/articles/independent_contrast_regression_shell.html}{shell script}
with \code{BayesTraits.shell} for multiple phylogenetic regression analyses.
