\arguments{
\item{meanfile_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the mean data file(s)
of samples of trait data is(are) stored.}

\item{linkfile_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the linked data file(s)
of samples of trait data is(are) stored.}

\item{treefile_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the tree file is stored.}

\item{BayesTraits_dir}{Path to the folder directory where the BayesTraits
executable file is stored.}

\item{responvar}{Report the name of the response variable of your analysis.}

\item{treetransf}{In vector format, report tree transformation models to be
estimated, such as \emph{Kappa}, \emph{Delta}, \emph{Lambda}, \emph{OU} (Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck).
A model of variable rates \emph{VR} or the \emph{Fabric} model can be reported here,
the latter of which is a statistical model accommodating an uneven evolutionary
landscape, as described by \href{https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28595-z}{Pagel et al. (2022)}.
We use \emph{UNI} as a designation for uniform rates of evolution (no \emph{VR} estimated)
and no other tree transformation models estimated.}

\item{bi}{Set the number of iterations for the MCMC burnin. Report this number
as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{it}{Set the number of total iterations for the MCMC chain. Report this number
as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{sa}{Set the sample frequency. Report this number as a character (i.e., in quotes).}

\item{st}{The stepping stone sampler to estimate the marginal likelihood. Report
the number of stones to use and the number of iterations for each stone as
characters (i.e., a vector of numbers each in quotes).}

\item{syst}{Report the operating system ("unix" or "windows").}

\item{dir_create}{Path to the computer's working directory or where the file(s) will
be saved. The default setting creates a directory "results_BayesTraits_output" in
which the results will be saved within a subfolder named by the current date.}

\item{cc_DataTree}{Logical, the default is \code{TRUE}. A copy of the tree file and
the mean and linked data files will be made in the BayesTraits folder where the
BayesTraits executable file is located.}

\description{
By reporting the directory paths to the tree and data files,
this function produces shell scripts in both Unix and Windows PowerShell
formats for running one or multiple phylogenetic regression analyses with
Meade & Pagel's (2022) \href{http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html}{BayesTraits}
program. In addition to generating the shell script directly in the BayesTraits
directory, the function also creates BayesTraits batch files with specified
parameters (e.g., bi, it, sa, and st) and model of tree transformations.
See \href{http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/Files/BayesTraitsV4.0.0-Manual.pdf}{BayesTraits V4.0.0 Manual}
for further details on the available BayesTraits parameters for phylogenetic
regression so as to better understand how to set the arguments of the current
function \code{BayesTraits.shell}. You might want to consider using
the function \code{\link{BayesTraits.inputs}} to generate properly formatted input files
of mean and linked samples of trait data prior to using \code{BayesTraits.shell}.
